## Executive Summary

The global shift toward cleaner energy and advanced industrial processes has increased the demand for sustainable, ethically sourced critical metals. Eryvium GmbH, headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, specializes in critical metals and boasts extensive expertise in manganese and iron ore processing across Europe and Asia.

### Strategic Location
The company is developing a cutting-edge beneficiation facility in South Africa's Northern Cape Special Economic Zone (SEZ) on a 7-hectare site, ideally situated among numerous local mining operations—ensuring a steady, high-quality ore supply and creating synergy with surrounding miners.

### Value Proposition
The plant upgrades lower-grade manganese ore into premium industrial and battery-grade products, addressing surging demand from EV battery manufacturers and high-performance steel producers while strengthening supply chain resilience.

### On-Site Processing Advantage
Processing ore at its source empowers local miners, drives job creation, and meets stringent ESG standards.

## Business Model & Revenue Streams
